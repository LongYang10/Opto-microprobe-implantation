# Opto-microprobe-implantation
This is a demonstration of opto-microprobe implantation surgery for D1/D2 tagging experiment with freely moving mice.
A. Front and side view of the opto-microprobe holder.
B. Demonstration of post-surgery setup. The whole recording system was protacted with headstage cap, optical-fiber cap and hs-connector cap from the moisture environment and animal bites.
C. 2-layers opto-microprobe mounting setup. 1st layer using Vaseline (tips learned from Neuropixel implantation) as buffer layer to absorb micro-vibration during movement. And 2nd layer using dental cement to fix the rigid part directly onto skull.
D. Details inside the head cap. Flex PCB was folded up to fit into the cap and GND wire was wrapped around the GND screw.
