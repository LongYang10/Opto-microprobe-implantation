# Opto-microprobe-implantation
This is a demonstration of opto-microprobe implantation surgery for D1/D2 tagging experiment with freely moving mice. <br>
<br>
A. Front and side view of the opto-microprobe holder. <br>
B. Demonstration of post-surgery setup. The whole recording system was protected with headstage cap, optical-fiber cap and hs-connector cap from the moisture environment and animal bites. <br>
C. 2-layers opto-microprobe mounting setup. 1st layer using Vaseline (tips learned from Neuropixel implantation) as buffer layer to absorb micro-vibration during movement. And 2nd layer using dental cement to fix the rigid part directly onto skull. <br>
D. Details inside the head cap. Flex PCB was folded up to fit into the cap and GND wire was wrapped around the GND screw. <br>
